 ### Tools used in course

#### The Go Programming Language
* Our app is written in Go. If you’re not already using Go, you owe it to yourself to try it out.
* https://golang.org/

#### Google Cloud Shell
* A free temp VM preloaded with the tools need to manage our clusters.
* https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/

#### Docker
* We use Docker to package, distribute, and run our application.

#### Kubernetes
* Once we have an application, we use Kubernetes to handle the heavy lifting of managing, deploying, and scaling our application.

#### Google Container Engine (GKE)
* GKE is a hosted Kubernetes service
